# pingtest.sh, v1.0.1
# Created 2009 by Bennett Lee
# Released to public domain
#
# (1) Attempts to ping several hosts to test connectivity.  After
#     first successful ping, script exits.
# (2) If all pings fail, resets interface and retries all pings.
# (3) If all pings fail again after reset, then reboots pfSense.
#
# History
# 1.0.1   Added delay to ensure interface resets (thx ktims).
# 1.0.0   Initial release.
#=====================================================================

# USER SETTINGS
#
# Set multiple ping targets separated by space.  Include numeric IPs
# (e.g., remote office, ISP gateway, etc.) for DNS issues which
# reboot will not correct.
